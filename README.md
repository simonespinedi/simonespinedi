My name is Simone,I'm an Italian passionate about the Tech World. My main expertise is on Network Engineering. Stuff like tweak protocols, create tunnels, filtering traffic and so on.

Anyway, I don't want to be a self-bottleneck. So i started growing skills on system administration, automation and development.

My life motto is **"I'm not the G.O.A.T but i fit the description"**, an absolute quote from Lil Baby in the song "Want and Needs" with Drake. Standing to my motto, i do not pretend to be expert in any area, but i can give my contribution.

<p><b>What you can find here?</b></p>
My growth. Me expanding my abiities. And maybe something useful.
